An encrypted pastebin.

Rly

I encrypt your data only when I receive them. So if in the meantime someone sniffs them, it's not my fault. Anyway, using TLS you should be safe enough.

Tips
----
In order to improve performance, enable caching and gzip compression when you serve static resources.


Install
-------
```
$ npm   install
$ npm   install -g bower
$ bower install
$ npm   start
```
